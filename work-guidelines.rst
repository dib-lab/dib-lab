Weekly reports
--------------

Everyone is expected to file brief weekly reports on what they've been
up to; this provides both Titus and the lab member with context and
trajectory going forward, and means that in-person meetings can focus
on specific issues rather than be more general reporting.

Filing weekly reports is part of being a lab member.  Repeated failure
to file weekly reports may be taken to imply that you no longer wish
to be a member of the lab.  Note also that it is not Titus' job to
remind you to submit weekly reports.

----

Weekly reports can and should be minimalist - basically, list

* what you've been working on for the lab, including progress made 
  and obstacles overcome;
* deferred items and upcoming issues;
* long term goals;
* anything else you want Titus to know, including personal issues.

Most of the weekly report can be copy-pasted from the previous week;
feel free to do so.  If it takes you more than 10 minutes to do each
week, you're probably overdoing it.

----

Weekly reports should be filed *weekly*, and generally by the same
time each week, as long as you let Titus know when that is (e.g. by
Friday 5pm; or by Monday noon; or...)

If you are taking time off, then note that in advance and don't submit
weekly reports during that period.

If work-related travel is coming up, please submit a report BEFORE the
travel and AFTER the travel.

Travel
------

* Get permission from Titus before booking any travel over $200.
  Under $200, "lazy consensus" can be applied (see :doc:`philosophy`).
  3 working days notice, please.

* Travel should be booked 15 days in advance in order to be reimbursable.

* To book flights on lab money in advance, contact Jason Queen with
  your travel request and CC Titus on the e-mail.

* To get reimbursed for trips, contact Jason Queen with your reimbursement
  request and CC Titus on the e-mail.

Orders
------

The lab money is to be used for support of our research goals; so,
Titus will generally consider requests to buy research materials
(computers, books, etc.) favorably.  Please sketch out the need in a
sentence, price things out roughly (or precisely :), and maybe
identify alternatives (more and/or less expensive).

Under $5000,

* Orders under $5000 can be done without a PO, by contacting Jason
  Queen.  Please CC Titus.

* Under $200, use "lazy consensus" (see :doc:`philosophy`).  3 working days
  notice, please.

* Jason will need the paperwork that comes with the order (the packing
  slip and/or invoice) - please sign it, date it, and convey it to
  Jason.  (Consistent failure to do this will result in revocation of
  the ability to order anything yourself. We're serious.)

Over $5000, Titus needs to be involved with POs...
