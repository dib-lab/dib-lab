  as former lab members;

**Graduate student responsibilities**:

## Weekly reports

Weekly reports are a way to report what lab members have been
up to; this provides both Titus and the lab member with context and
trajectory going forward, and means that in-person meetings can focus
on specific issues rather than be more general reporting.

Weekly reports can be emailed to Titus privately or to the whole lab 
via the internal mailing list. 

Weekly reports can and should be minimalist - basically, list

* what you've been working on for the lab, including progress made 
  and obstacles overcome;
* deferred items and upcoming issues;
* long term goals;
* work-related travel;
* anything else you want Titus to know, including personal issues.

Most of the weekly report can be copy-pasted from the previous week;
feel free to do so.  If it takes you more than 60 minutes to do each
week, you're probably overdoing it.

----

Weekly reports should be filed *weekly*, and generally by the same
time each week, as long as you let Titus know when that is (e.g. by
Friday 5pm; or by Monday noon; or...)

If you are taking time off, then note that in advance and don't submit
weekly reports during that period.

If work-related travel is coming up, please submit a report BEFORE the
travel and AFTER the travel.

## Travel

* Get permission from Titus before booking any travel over $200.
  Under $200, "lazy consensus" can be applied (see [philosophy]({{site.github.url}}/philosophy)).
  3 working days notice, please.

* Travel should be booked 15 days in advance in order to be reimbursable.

* To book flights on lab money in advance, contact Jason Queen with
  your travel request and CC Titus on the e-mail.

* To get reimbursed for trips, contact Jason Queen with your reimbursement
  request and CC Titus on the e-mail.

## Orders

The lab money is to be used for support of our research goals; so,
Titus will generally consider requests to buy research materials
(computers, books, etc.) favorably.  Please sketch out the need in a
sentence, price things out roughly (or precisely :), and maybe
identify alternatives (more and/or less expensive).

Under $5000,

* Orders under $5000 can be done without a PO, by contacting Jason
  Queen.  Please CC Titus.

* Under $200, use "lazy consensus" (see [philosophy]({{site.github.url}}/philosophy)).  3 working days
  notice, please.

* Jason will need the paperwork that comes with the order (the packing
  slip and/or invoice) - please sign it, date it, and convey it to
  Jason.  (Consistent failure to do this will result in revocation of
  the ability to order anything yourself. We're serious.)

Over $5000, Titus needs to be involved with POs...
