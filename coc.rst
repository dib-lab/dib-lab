Lab Code of Conduct
===================

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree
with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as
needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a
safe environment for everybody.

The Quick Version
-----------------

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab
members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not
appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations,
or discussions.  (However, do note that we work on biological matters
so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction *are*
appropriate.)

The Less Quick Version
----------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact `Titus Brown
<mailto:ctbrown@ucdavis.edu>`__ immediately.  If Titus is the cause of
your concern, Cait Pickens (caitsydney at gmail.com) is a good
informal point of contact; she does not work for Titus or UC Davis,
and has agreed to mediate.  For official concerns, please see `the UC
Davis ombuds office <http://ombuds.ucdavis.edu/>`__.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.
