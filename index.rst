Welcome to the Lab for Data Intensive Biology at UC Davis!
==========================================================

tl; dr? Data good, data analysis better.

The DIB Lab tackles questions surrounding biological data analysis,
data integration, and data sharing.  Our primary interest is in
genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic sequence analysis.

In brief,

* the lab is the primary developer of the `khmer
  <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/>`__, `sourmash
  <https://github.com/dib-lab/sourmash>`__, and `spacegraphcats
  <https://github.com/spacegraphcats/spacegraphcats>`__ software for
  faster and more efficient sequence analysis of high-throughput
  sequencing data.

* we run quite a bit of `training in data-intensive biology
  <http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/>`__.
  
* the lab is located at the `University of California, Davis
  <http://ucdavis.edu>`__ in the `School of Veterinary Medicine
  <http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu>`__.

The lab is run by Dr. C. Titus Brown, an Associate Professor at UC
Davis; you can see many of the lab's publications `here
<https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O4rYanMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate>`__. You
can read more about the lab members under :doc:`members`.
