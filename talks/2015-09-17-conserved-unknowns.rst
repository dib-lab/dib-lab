Abstract:

Two-thirds of protein-coding genes in humans are conserved between
humans and invertebrates, and must therefore be crucial for metazoan
biology. But many of these genes are still effectively unknown:
their products often have no well-defined function, and sometimes
even lack recognizable protein domains. My colleagues and I are
using a combination of bioinformatics and biology in the nematode       
Caenorhabditis elegans to begin identifying roles for 160 families       
of these "conserved unknown" genes. I will describe the strategy we
used to identify the genes, some of their known traits, and our
results from loss-of-function genetic assays (via RNAi and deletion
alleles) in cell migration, chemosensation, and neurotransmission.
